# Maintain Healthy Wellbeing

Remember to take breaks. Maintain Wellbeing!
Dont overwork yourself, don't act non-challant about your health.


## Overview

As a frequent computer user, I've often found myself lost in the digital world, forgetting to take care of my physical and visual health. Prolonged screen time can lead to eye strain, back pain, and a host of other issues. To combat this, I've developed a Chrome extension that reminds me to take regular breaks, stay hydrated, and protect my eyes.

Spending extended periods in front of a screen can have serious consequences for our health. Eye strain, headaches, and blurred vision are just a few of the potential issues that can arise from prolonged screen time. Furthermore, sitting for extended periods can lead to back pain, poor posture, and a range of other musculoskeletal problems.

To mitigate the negative effects of prolonged screen time, I turned to the 20-20-20 rule, as recommended by Healthline's article, "(https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/20-20-20-rule)." This simple rule suggests that every 20 minutes, you should look away from your screen and focus on something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. By following this rule, you can reduce eye strain and promote healthier vision.

My Chrome extension, Take a Break, is designed to help you implement the 20-20-20 rule and stay healthy while working on your computer. Every 20 minutes, the extension will remind you to take a break, stand up, and look away from the screen. You'll also receive reminders to stay hydrated and move around, helping you avoid the negative effects of prolonged sitting.

By using Take a Break, you can:

- Reduce eye strain: By following the 20-20-20 rule, you can reduce the risk of eye strain and promote healthier vision.
- Improve posture: Regular breaks can help you avoid developing poor posture and reduce the risk of back pain.
- Stay hydrated: The extension's hydration reminders can help you stay on top of your water intake and avoid dehydration.
- Increase productivity: Taking regular breaks can help you stay focused and productive, leading to better work outcomes.

Take a Break is designed to be flexible and customizable. You can easily adjust the time intervals to suit your needs, whether you prefer shorter or longer breaks. The extension is also designed to be unobtrusive, allowing you to work without distraction while still receiving important reminders.

Take a Break was developed as a final project for Harvard's CS50 course, a renowned computer science program that emphasizes problem-solving and critical thinking. I'm proud to have had the opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge to create a practical solution to a common problem.
